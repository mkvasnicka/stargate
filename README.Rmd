# stargate

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **stargate** package is to simplify production of formatted tables that hold regression analysis results from several models side-by-side.

For many years, we have used **stargazer** package for this purpose. **stargazer** is great and every applied econometrician has to be thankful to Marek Hlaváč for kindly providing it. However, this package is implemented as one monolithic function, which has two drawbacks: 

1. It is very difficult for an user to implement a method for an estimated object not covered in **stargazer**.
2. It has too many complex parameters. A set of lightweight manipulation function joined with pipes (in the tidyverse style) seems preferable.

This package is an attempt to rewrite **stargazer** in this fashion. To pay homage to the original package, it is named similarly: **stargate**.



## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of stargate from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("stargate")
```
-->

At the present time, there is only the development version. It is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mkvasnicka/stargate")
```



## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(stargate)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
